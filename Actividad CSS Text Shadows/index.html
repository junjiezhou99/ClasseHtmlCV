	<p>In Botswana's Chobe National Park, an elephant with an especially large trunk 
        is minding its own business when a plesiosaur with five heads, two tails, 
        and the legs of a lion falls out of the sky and lands on the elephant's back.
    </p>
    <p>"Hah hah! That's hilarious!", says the plesiosaur, "Your trunk is huge!"
    </p>
    <p>A stunned tourist in a nearby Jeep drops his camera, stares in amazement, and excitedly taps his wife on the shoulder.</p>
    <p>"Look, honey! That's amazing! The talking prehistoric marine reptile with five heads, 
        two tails, and the legs of a lion that fell out of the sky is right! That elephant's trunk is ginormous!"
