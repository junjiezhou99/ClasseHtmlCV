    <h1>A little tale accompanied by a little text shadow</h1>
    <p>If ever there was evidence of God, the humble pea is it.</p>
    <p>Mother Nature has never created something of such perfection, something that takes Darwin's theory of evolution to 
        the extent that a natural element can, over millions of years, evolve into something so flawless.</p>

            <p>The green seed of the white-flowering climbing leguminous papilionaceous plant, pisum sativum, has become a dining-table favourite for good reason.</p>

            <p>The perfect accompaniment to any meal, the diminutive spherical vegetable brings joy to billions worldwide, be they fresh, frozen, canned or dried.</p>

        <article class="message">
            <p>Even leaving aside the astounding nutritional package, the taste explosion and texture of a well cooked pea is undeniably enough to award this deceptively simple seed the gold-medal of the foodstuff Olympics.</p>

    <p>There is debate surrounding the tampering of the form of the original spherical vegetable. 
        The question as to whether the 'mushy' pea is sacrilege or an innovative approach to re-package the perfect 
        product is a sensitive issue. A similar argument arises when approaching the relatively new craze of mangetout. 
        In-depth study is required, but for now it is too early to assess the true importance of this baby pea pod.</p>
    <p>In its original form, the pea is a giant amongst food products and a deity of the vegetable world. It is not 
        an exaggeration to say that peas can be described as nothing less than perfect spheres of joy.</p>
